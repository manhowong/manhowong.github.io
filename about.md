Man Ho Wong, 王文豪 (*he/him*) 

I am a neuroscientist/ data scientist and a part-time graduate student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Interactive Intelligence.

I am fascinated by the complex interplay of reward-driven behaviors, experience, and language functions. With an engineering mindset, my interests have expanded to scientific computing, data science and computational linguistics throughout my academic journey. My ultimate goal is to unify my passions and explore the realms of NLP and interactive AI, bridging the gaps between human cognition and technology.
