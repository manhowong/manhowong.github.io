I will try to keep this short.

## Undergraduate and doctoral training

I have always been interested in life sciences, or simply life itself as I realized later. I am equally fascinated by language and perception. However, growing up in a low-income family, there are unfortunately [other considerations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/07/08/dept-of-data-academia-elite/) in life besides your passions. I was no exception. In the end I chose to study applied biology and biotechnology in university, the more "practical" fields (in terms of job prospects) as I thought at the time which are still aligned with my interests.

At the end of my second year in university, I got an opportunity to work on a research project on developmental biology at Caltech during the summer. Not only did it present me the beauty of development, it also let me see myself in a research career as a first-generation university student. After my undergraduate training, I finally decided to pursue my research passion and moved to Germany to study neuroscience.

While I was studying the neural correlates of vision development in Germany, I came across Buddhism and immediately found myself drawn to their worldview, in particular their view on time perception. [Time perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_perception) has a central role in human cognition, including decision making and motivation. To learn more about the neural circuitry governing motivation-guided behaviors, I started my postdoctoral project in my current lab which was hosted at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT then.

## Postdoctoral training and career transition

Picower is housed in the same building with other MIT's brain sciences departments and research centers, including labs working on the cognitive branch of linguistics. Building 46 (as it is affectionately called) is the place where I was introduced to linguistics research and where I saw the possibility to combine my interests in different fields for the first time. During my time there, I went to talks and seminars in psycho- and cognitive linguistics as far as my schedule allowed, although at the time I had only a very basic knowledge of linguistics. Nevertheless, the exciting linguistics works happening in Building 46 opened a whole new world for me.

In the fall of 2019, our lab got a chance to move to Brown University in Rhode Island. Although moving would delay my postdoctoral research, I still decided to move to Brown with my lab and took it as an opportunity for broader exposure to different linguistics fields before I am ready to find my own research niche in linguistics. Brown is the birthplace of the [Brown Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Corpus), which played a pivotal role in the development of corpus linguistics and computational linguistics. Continuing my self-directed learning of linguistics at Brown, I started to appreciate the importance of computational methods in linguistics research.

During my last year of postdoctoral training, the lab relocated to Pittsburgh in summer 2021. At the University of Pittsburgh, I feel so fortunate to have met a few professors and mentors in the department of linguistics who could see my enthusiasm in language sciences and guided me through my exploration into linguistics. To develop a more systematic understanding of natural language and our cognition, I started taking classes in phonology, the study of the sound system that connects our mental world and the physical world. At the same time, I joined the Pitt Python Linguistics Group (PyLing), a local community of linguists from Pitt and also CMU, to learn more about computational methods in linguistics. I also started my very first (and hopefully not too primitive) computational linguistics project at Pitt to put my knowledge into practice. Pitt is the place where I launched my career transition into the intersection of linguistics and neuroscience.

I think I should stop here as it's getting too long for an internet post about a random person. If you are still interested, I am happy to provide my CV ([email](mailto:mh.wongg@gmail.com)). I also invite you to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manhowong).
