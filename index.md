Man Ho Wong, 王文豪 (*he/him*) 

I am a neuroscientist/ biophysicist currently working at the University of Pittsburgh, USA. I am fascinated by the capacity of human cognition. The emergence of such a complex system through rudimentary processes during development intrigues me the most. I am particularly interested in two cognitive functions: motivation and language.

At this stage of my career, I am studying the neural correlates of motivation-related behaviors. I have also started a computational linguistics project looking at the development of lexical-semantic networks in young children. In the future, I hope to explore more in language acquisition, an area which combines my interests in language, motivation and development.
