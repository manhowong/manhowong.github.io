Man Ho Wong, 王文豪  

I am a neuroscientist/ biophysicist currently working at the University of Pittsburgh, USA. I am fascinated by the capacity of human cognition. The emergence of such a complex system through rudimentary processes during development intrigues me the most. I am particularly interested in two cognitive functions: motivation and language.

At this stage of my career, I am studying the neural correlates of motivation-related behaviors ([read more](/research/#experience-dependent-maturation-of-the-reward-circuitry)). I have also started a project looking at the development of lexical-semantic networks in young children ([read more](research/#lexical-semantic-network-analysis-in-children-from-different-socio-economic-backgrounds)). In the future, I hope to explore language acquisition more, an area which synthesizes my interests in language, motivation and development.
