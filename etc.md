## TL;DR Word Clouds

My [bio page](/bio) might still be too long by internet standards. Here is the TL;DR ("too long; didn't read") version: The word clouds below summarize my experience (education and work) as of *October 2022*. Because I am in the middle of career transition, you may notice that the word clouds contain words from different fields!

The word clouds were generated from the text data scraped from this website. The first word cloud was generated from the top 100 most frequent **nouns** (word count includes their derivatives):

The second word cloud was generated from **noun phrases** (with plural phrases converted to singular):
