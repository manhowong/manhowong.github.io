Looking for a TL;DR ("too long; didn't read") version of this website? The word clouds below summarize my experience (education and work) as of *October 2022*. Because I am in the middle of career transition, you may notice that the word clouds contain words from different fields!

The word clouds are generated from the text data scraped from this website. The first word cloud is generated from only top 100 most frequent **nouns** (word count includes their derivatives):
